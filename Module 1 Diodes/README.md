## 2. Characteristics of Power Diodes

### 2.1. Device Physics and Operation

Power diodes operate according to the fundamental Shockley diode equation, which governs the exponential relationship between current and voltage [1]:

$$
I_D = I_S \left( e^{\frac{V_D}{n V_T}} - 1 \right)
$$

Where:
- $I_D$: Diode current (A)
- $I_S$: Reverse saturation current (A)
- $V_D$: Diode voltage (V)
- $n$: Ideality factor (1-2)
- $V_T$: Thermal voltage ≈ 26 mV at 300K

Power diodes are characterized by their vertical structure with a lightly doped n⁻ drift region, which enables high reverse voltage blocking capability while maintaining reasonable forward voltage drop [2].

- Maximum junction temperature (T_j(max)): typically 150°C to 175°C

**Dynamic Characteristics:**

## 3. Types of Diodes

### 3.1. General-Purpose Diodes

General-purpose power diodes are designed for low-frequency rectification applications (50-400 Hz) [1]. These devices prioritize robustness and high current-carrying capability over switching speed.

**Characteristics:**
- High current ratings: 1A to 4000A
- High voltage ratings: 50V to 6000V
- Reverse recovery time: 25μs to 30μs
- Applications: Line-frequency rectifiers, welding equipment, motor drives

### 3.2. Fast-Recovery Diodes

Fast-recovery diodes are optimized for high-frequency switching applications where minimizing reverse recovery time is critical [2].

**Design Features:**
- Controlled minority carrier lifetime
- Optimized doping profiles
- Special processing techniques

**Performance Specifications:**
- Reverse recovery time: 25ns to 500ns
- Softness factor: S > 1 (soft recovery preferred)
- Applications: DC-DC converters, inverters, SMPS

### 3.3. Schottky Diodes

Schottky diodes utilize a metal-semiconductor junction instead of a p-n junction, resulting in unique characteristics [3].

**Advantages:**
- Low forward voltage drop: 0.3V to 0.5V
- Negligible reverse recovery time (no stored charge)
- Fast switching capability

**Limitations:**
- Limited reverse voltage: typically < 200V
- Higher reverse leakage current
- Temperature-sensitive characteristics

## 4. Freewheeling Operation

Freewheeling diodes are essential components in circuits containing inductive elements. When the main switching device is turned off, the inductor current cannot change instantaneously due to Lenz's law [1]. The freewheeling diode provides a continuous current path, preventing destructive voltage spikes.

### 4.1. Physical Principle

For an inductor with stored energy:
$$E_L = \frac{1}{2}LI^2$$

When the switch opens, di/dt would theoretically become infinite without a freewheeling path, leading to:
$$v_L = L\frac{di}{dt} \rightarrow \infty$$

The freewheeling diode limits this voltage to approximately one diode drop (0.7V-1.5V).

### 4.2. Circuit Behavior

During freewheeling operation:
- Inductor current decays exponentially: $i_L(t) = I_0 e^{-\frac{R}{L}t}$
- Energy is dissipated in the circuit resistance
- Protection is provided to switching elements

## 5. Rectifiers with Diodes

### 5.1. Single-Phase Full-Wave Rectifiers

Single-phase bridge rectifiers convert AC voltage to pulsating DC using four diodes arranged in a bridge configuration [2]. This topology provides full utilization of both half-cycles of the input AC waveform.

**Circuit Operation:**
- During positive half-cycle: D1 and D2 conduct
- During negative half-cycle: D3 and D4 conduct
- Load current flows in the same direction throughout

**Key Performance Parameters:**

**Average Output Voltage:**
$$V_{dc} = \frac{2V_m}{\pi} = 0.637 V_m$$

**RMS Output Voltage:**
$$V_{rms} = \frac{V_m}{\sqrt{2}} = 0.707 V_m$$

**Ripple Factor:**
$$RF = \sqrt{\left(\frac{V_{rms}}{V_{dc}}\right)^2 - 1} = 0.482$$

**Peak Inverse Voltage (PIV):**
$$PIV = V_m$$

### 5.2. Three-Phase Full-Wave Rectifiers

Three-phase bridge rectifiers utilize six diodes to convert three-phase AC to DC, providing superior performance compared to single-phase systems [3].

**Circuit Operation:**
- At any instant, two diodes conduct (one from upper group, one from lower group)
- Each diode conducts for 120° per cycle
- Natural commutation occurs at line voltage crossings

**Performance Metrics:**

**Average Output Voltage:**
$$V_{dc} = \frac{3\sqrt{6}V_{LL}}{\pi} = 1.35 V_{LL}$$

**Ripple Factor:**
$$RF = \sqrt{\left(\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{9}\right)} = 0.042$$

**Peak Inverse Voltage:**
$$PIV = \sqrt{3}V_{LL}$$

### 6.1. Fundamental Performance Metrics

**Rectification Efficiency (η):**
$$\eta = \frac{P_{dc}}{P_{ac}} = \frac{V_{dc} \cdot I_{dc}}{V_{rms} \cdot I_{rms}}$$

**Transformer Utilization Factor (TUF):**
$$TUF = \frac{P_{dc}}{VA_{rating}} = \frac{V_{dc} \cdot I_{dc}}{V_{s} \cdot I_{s}}$$

**Form Factor (FF):**
$$FF = \frac{V_{rms}}{V_{dc}}$$

**Peak Factor (PF):**
$$PF = \frac{V_{peak}}{V_{rms}}$$

### 6.2. Harmonic Analysis

**Total Harmonic Distortion (THD):**
$$THD = \frac{\sqrt{\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} I_n^2}}{I_1} \times 100\%$$

**Displacement Power Factor (DPF):**
$$DPF = \cos(\phi_1)$$

Where $\phi_1$ is the phase angle of the fundamental component.

### 6.3. Comparative Performance

| Parameter | Single-Phase | Three-Phase |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Ripple Factor | 0.482 | 0.042 |
| TUF | 0.812 | 0.955 |
| PIV/V_dc | 1.57 | 1.05 |
| Efficiency | ~81% | ~95% |

## 7. Design of a Rectifier Circuit

### 7.1. Design Methodology

The design of a rectifier circuit requires systematic consideration of load requirements, component selection, and performance optimization [1][3].

**Design Steps:**
1. **Load Analysis:** Determine DC voltage and current requirements
2. **Topology Selection:** Choose between single-phase or three-phase based on power level
3. **Diode Selection:** Specify voltage and current ratings with safety margins
4. **Filter Design:** Calculate filter components to meet ripple requirements
5. **Thermal Management:** Ensure adequate heat dissipation

### 7.2. Component Selection Criteria

**Diode Specifications:**
- **Voltage Rating:** $V_{RRM} \geq 2 \times PIV$ (safety factor)
- **Current Rating:** $I_{F(AV)} \geq 1.5 \times I_{load}$ (safety factor)
- **Reverse Recovery:** Select based on switching frequency requirements

**Filter Design:**
For capacitive filtering, the capacitor value is determined by:
$$C = \frac{I_{load}}{2fV_{ripple}}$$

Where f is the ripple frequency and $V_{ripple}$ is the acceptable ripple voltage.

### 7.3. Design Example

**Specifications:**
- Output: 24V DC, 5A
- Input: 230V AC, 50Hz
- Ripple: < 5%

**Solution:**
- Transformer turns ratio: $n = \frac{230}{\frac{24 \times \pi}{2}} = 6.1$
- Diode PIV: $24 \times \frac{\pi}{2} = 37.7V$ → Select 100V diodes
- Diode current: 5A average → Select 10A diodes
- Filter capacitor: $C = \frac{5}{2 \times 100 \times 1.2} = 20.8mF$ → Use 22mF
